# LaraPOS – Full Stack POS & Web Application Platform

LaraPOS is a full-stack web application platform built with Laravel, React (Inertia.js), Docker, and PostgreSQL/MySQL.  
It is designed using production-level architecture principles to demonstrate scalable backend design, modern frontend integration, and containerized development environments.

This project reflects real-world backend and full-stack engineering practices.

---

## Overview

LaraPOS provides a structured backend system and web interface foundation for building POS systems, dashboards, or business management applications.

It uses Laravel as the core backend framework, React with Inertia.js for the frontend, and Docker for environment consistency and deployment readiness.

The architecture is designed to support both web applications and future mobile integration via REST API.

## Development Environment

This project uses Docker to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.

Services include:

- PHP (Laravel)
- Nginx
- PostgreSQL

---

## Purpose

This project was built to demonstrate my ability to:

- Design scalable backend systems using Laravel
- Integrate modern frontend technologies (React + Inertia)
- Use Docker for professional development environments
- Structure full-stack applications using clean architecture principles

It represents production-oriented engineering practices rather than tutorial-based development.
